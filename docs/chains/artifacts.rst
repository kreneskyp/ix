Artifact Chains
======================

Chains that integrate with the artifact system. Artifacts are used to
to record milestones, state, objects, and change created by a chain. Artifacts
provide a reference point to interact with these results in subsequent
chains.

SaveArtifact
------------

SaveArtifact saves an artifact to the database. The artifact properties
may be generated by an LLM, chain, or generated statically.

Artifact Import:

-   `artifact_from_key`: The key to load the artifact from. Any properties defined in the artifact will be saved on the artifact. Static values will override these values.

Static Attributes:
Static attributes may be defined to override attributes loaded from an artifact.
If not loading from an artifact, then all attributes are required.

-   `artifact_key`: The key to save the artifact under. This key may be used to reference the artifact in subsequent requests.
-   `artifact_type`: The type of artifact to save. This is used to determine how the artifact is stored and displayed.
-   `artifact_name`: The name of the artifact to save.
-   `artifact_description`: The description of the artifact to save.

Storage:
Artifacts may also be optionally saved to a storage backend. Define
`artifact_storage` to define the storage function.

-   `artifact_storage`: The storage to use for the artifact. This is used to determine how the artifact is stored and how it may be queried.
-   `artifact_storage_id`: The storage id to use for the artifact. This may be a database id, file path, or other identifier depending on the storage type.

Input / Output:

-  `content_key`: The key to load the content from. This is automatically set as an input_variable
-  `content_path`: jsonpath relative to `inputs` for content to save. This is used to extract a subset of the content to save. If not set, the entire content at `content_key`.
-  `output_key`: The key to save the artifact under. This key may be used to reference the artifact in subsequent requests.

Artifact format:

`Artifact` when represented as a dictionary have the following format. Fields
values may be generated by the chain or set statically by the config.

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "key": "my_key",
        "type": "my_type",
        "name": "my_name",
        "description": "my_description",
        "storage": "my_storage",           # Optional
        "storage_id": "my_storage_id",     # Required with storage
        "data": "my_data",                 # Optional
    }


Saving an existing artifact:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Artifact` dicts may be generated by a chain and then passed to `SaveArtifact`.


.. code-block:: python

    # This example assumes that name, key, description are loaded from `file_artifact`
    # remaining attributes are set statically.
    SAVE_ARTIFACT = {
        "class_path": "ix.chains.artifacts.SaveArtifact",
        "config" : {
            "artifact_from_key": "file_artifact",     # Artifact input
            "artifact_type": "file",                  # static type
            "artifact_storage": "write_to_file",      # static storage
            "content_key": "generated_file_json",     # content input
            "output_key": "generated_file_artifact",  # artifact output
        }
    }

    # create node
    root = ChainNode.objects.create(**PARSE_JSON_CONFIG)




Statically defining artifact properties:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Artifact` dicts may be generated by a chain and then passed to `SaveArtifact`.


.. code-block:: python

    # everything but content and identifier is statically defined
    SAVE_STATIC_ARTIFACT = {
        "class_path": "ix.chains.artifacts.SaveArtifact",
        "config": {
            "artifact_key": "file_list",
            "artifact_name": "file_list",
            "artifact_description": "list of files that will be generated",
            "artifact_type": "artifact_list",
            "content_key": "file_artifacts_json",
            "output_key": "file_artifacts_list",
        },
    }

    # create node
    root = ChainNode.objects.create(**PARSE_JSON_CONFIG)





Extracting content with a jsonpath:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set `content_path` to extract a subset of the content to save. If not set,
the entire content at `content_key` will be saved.

.. code-block:: python

    SAVE_ARTIFACT = {
        "class_path": "ix.chains.artifacts.SaveArtifact",
        "config" : {
            "content_key": "generated_file_json",
            "content_path": "generated_file_json.data",
        }
    }

    # create node
    root = ChainNode.objects.create(**PARSE_JSON_CONFIG)
